# vproxy

[中文文档](https://github.com/wkgcass/vproxy/blob/master/README_ZH.md)

## Intro

VProxy is a zero-dependency TCP Loadbalancer based on Java NIO. The project only requires Java 11 to run.

Clone it, javac it, then everything is ready for running.

(Gradlew and Dockerfile is also provided)

## Aim

* Zero dependency: no dependency other than java standard library, and no jni extensions.
* Simple: keep code simple and clear.
* Modifiable when running: no need to reload for configuration update.
* Fast: performance is one of our main priorities.
* TCP Loadbalancer: we now support TCP and TCP based protocols, also allow your own protocols.

## How to use

### Simple mode

You can start a simple loadbalancer in one command:

```
java -Deploy=Simple -jar vproxy.jar \  
                bind {port} \
                backend {host1:port1,host2:port2} \
                [ssl {path of cert1,cert2} {path of key} \]
                [protocol {...} \]
```

Use `help` to view the parameters.

### Standard mode

See docs for help.  
Questions about implementation detail are also welcome (in issues).
