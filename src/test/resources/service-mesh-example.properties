# Since the vproxy starts multiple lbs, the config should specify an alias
# in the format: auto_lb.$alias.config. Change $alias to the name you like.
#
# This section is ignored if mode = sidecar.

# Except writing the configuration, the lbs can also be added or removed
# during runtime. However, the modified settings at runtime will not be
# persisted into a file and will be lost if vproxy process restarts.
